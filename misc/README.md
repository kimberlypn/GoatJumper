# Misc

This directory contains the additional files specific to the IDEs that we are 
using, namely Visual Studio and XCode. One of our members is using Windows, 
while the other three are using Macs, so our projects are slightly different. 
However, the `Game` directory contains all of the `.hpp` and `.cpp` files that 
are common amongst all of us and that we are submitting for grading.
